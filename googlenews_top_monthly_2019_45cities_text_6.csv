New York,1,https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/28/us/new-york-child-victims-act/index.html,"New York (CNN) The New York State Legislature passed a bill on Monday that will increase the statute of limitations for cases of child sexual abuse.

The Child Victims Act will allow child victims to seek prosecution against their abuser until the age of 55 in civil cases, a significant increase from the previous limit of age 23. For criminal cases, victims can seek prosecution until they turn 28. The bill also includes a one-year window during which victims of any age or time limit can come forward to prosecute.

""New York has just gone from being one of the worst states in the country to being one of the best,"" in terms of the statute of limitations for child sex abuse cases, said Marci Hamilton, CEO of Child USA and a professor at the University of Pennsylvania.

Hamilton said the bill ""represents over 15 years of work by survivors and advocates trying to get around the stiff opposition from the Catholic bishops and the insurance industry"" and is a step forward in the national conversation. There are eight other states considering similar legislation.

Survivors and supporters gather at the New York State Capitol Monday to celebrate the passage of the New York Child Victims Act.

What's the law nationally?

Many other states allow victims to sue their abusers for decades after their abuse. Oklahoma, for example, allows victims to come forward until age 45 in both civil and criminal cases.

""The fact that New York has stepped up and vastly improved its statute of limitations, it helps to pave the way for other states who haven't yet taken steps to improve their statute of limitations,"" said Stephen Forrester, director of government relations and administration at the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.

Forrester stressed the significance of the one-year window in the bill that will allow victims of all ages and time scales to come forward. ""That's an aspect that really goes a long way at restoring justice,"" he said, and it is less common nationally. According to advocacy group Child USA, nine states have no statute of limitations for civil cases, which would allow child sex abuse victims to come forward at any point in their life -- as they will be able to during the one-year window.

New York's law will also give victims significantly more time to disclose their histories of abuse. Experts, including Forrester, say there is a need for a long statute of limitations in cases of child sexual abuse because it can take victims years to come forward. ""For many different reasons, victims need time to come forward to report their abuse,"" Forrester said. Victims can often suffer from prolonged or delayed trauma.

According to statistics from Child USA, the majority of child sexual abuse victims do not choose to disclose, if they do at all, until the average age of 52.

Child USA's Hamilton said that extending the statute of limitation for civil litigation will help expand the public knowledge of how widespread child sexual abuse is. She said it is often during civil cases that experts learn about how patterns of abuse operate.

""We have this silent pandemic in this country,"" she said. ""We didn't really understand that this was everywhere.""

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 1 in 7 children have experienced child abuse and/or neglect in the last year.

Catholic Church opposition

Monday's bill passage comes after more than a decade of opposition from the Catholic Church in New York. In a news conference on Monday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is a Roman Catholic, blamed the church directly for preventing the bill's passage.

Speaking about why the bill took years to pass, Cuomo said, ""I believe it was the conservatives in the Senate who were threatened by the Catholic Church."" The bill passed the Senate unanimously on Monday. In November 2018, Democrats took over the Republican-held Senate.

Cuomo also referenced Pope Francis, who has spoken about the Catholic Church's need to confront its history of child sexual abuse. ""I don't think I'm against the Catholic Church,"" Cuomo said, ""I think the bishops may have a different position than the Pope, and I'm with the Pope,"" he said.

New York's Catholic Conference previously opposed the bill but dropped its opposition after the bill was amended to allow prosecution of both private and public institutions.

Attorney Mitchell Garabedian has prosecuted thousands of clergy abuse cases over the past 25 years, including those stemming from the Boston Globe's investigation of the Archdiocese of Boston.

In an interview Monday, Garabedian told CNN this legislation will be hugely significant. ""I think there will be a flood of litigation,"" he said, adding that he has more than 100 cases waiting to be filed.

""It's a model for many, many states in the United States for them to follow,"" Garabedian said. In a statement, he added, ""There is now hope for justice, respect and validation for thousands of sexual abuse victims sexually abused in New York.""

Cuomo's office said he is expected to sign the bill into law soon.","New York passes Child Victims Act, allowing child sex abuse survivors to sue their abusers","The Child Victims Act will allow child victims to seek prosecution against their abuser until the age of 55 in civil cases, a significant increase from the previous limit of age 23.

New York,1,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46994583,"Image copyright Livia Abreu/Erika Christensen/Merle Hoffman Image caption Three women with different perspectives on the new law

On the 46th anniversary of the landmark US ruling that made abortion legal, New York state signed into law a new abortion rights bill. Why is it so controversial?

The Reproductive Health Act (RHA) has been seen by some as a necessary move to safeguard abortion rights should the Supreme Court overturn the ruling, known as Roe v Wade.

And it comes at a time when states such as Mississippi, Iowa and Ohio are rolling back abortion provisions.

While others see it as an ""extreme"" and ""inhumane"" expansion of abortion access.

The act removes the need for a doctor to perform some abortions and takes abortion out of the criminal code, making it a public health issue.

However, the most controversial aspect of the RHA is the provision allowing abortions after 24 weeks in cases where there is an ""absence of foetal viability, or the abortion is necessary to protect the patient's life or health"".

The RHA has caused an intense and heated debate about how abortion is regulated in New York, with impassioned arguments made on each side.

We heard some of those views.

'Devastating'

In 2016, Erika Christensen was pregnant and living in New York with her husband. The couple were thrilled.

However, at 31 weeks, she found out that her pregnancy was ""nonviable"", meaning that the baby would not survive outside the womb.

Ms Christensen told the BBC that she ""didn't know about the law"" banning abortion in New York beyond 24 weeks.

""We wanted to end the suffering of this child. It was a simple choice.""

After doing some research she realised she would have to leave the state to terminate her pregnancy.

She borrowed $10,000 (ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ£7,600) from her mum, and flew halfway across the country to have an abortion in Colorado.

""I know I am lucky. I am middle-class and have access to those kinds of resources. But it was still really devastating.

""The laws of New York made the grieving process so much harder,"" Ms Christensen said. ""There is an inherent shame in having to leave your state to do this. It made a bad situation so much worse.""

Since then, she has campaigned for New York to change its laws on abortion.

She hopes that the RHA will help women in a similar situation to her ""work through their grief without having to fight the system"".

""These women should be able to focus on healing.""

'Time to double down'

Christina Fadden, chair of the anti-abortion organisation New York State Right to Life, told the BBC she was ""extremely saddened"" by the RHA being signed into law.

Ms Fadden said it was ""horrific"" that ""there is now no protection for unborn children in the state of New York"".

She disputes the assertion that the RHA is a necessary update to the state's law, and suggests that allowing abortions beyond 24 weeks is ""inhumane"".

Image copyright New York State Right To Life Image caption Christina Fadden speaking at the Syracuse March for Life in 2019

""I have got a fire in my belly and it's time to double down on fighting this,"" she said.

Ms Fadden is also concerned that the RHA makes abortion a ""fundamental right"" for women in New York, and will lead to ""pro-life viewpoint suppression"".

She told the BBC that her organisation has been ""overwhelmed"" by the number of people contacting them to volunteer in the wake of the RHA's ratification.

""We are still formulating our response, but we have to double our efforts.""

More on the US abortion debate

'A non-factor to the law'

While much of the discussion surrounding the RHA focuses on the 24-week provision, the removal of abortion from the criminal code is also controversial.

Pro-choice campaigners maintain that abortion is a healthcare issue, while opponents to the RHA say that it removes protection for pregnant victims of domestic abuse.

Livia Abreu was violently attacked by her boyfriend when she was 26 weeks pregnant. She was stabbed multiple times and lost her unborn baby.

Ms Abreu released a statement saying the RHA would decriminalise ""abortion as a product of an assault on a pregnant female"".

Image copyright Livia Abreu Image caption Livia Abreu is worried pregnant victims of domestic abuse will not be protected by the RHA

Her former partner is facing charges of abortion in the first and second degree, as well as attempted murder and assault.

""The passing of RHA will likely exonerate him from those charges,"" she wrote. ""Which will in turn lessen his sentence now that a judge has decided the case is going to trial and the new law will take effect prior to that date.

""Let that sink in. He will likely be convicted of the crimes he committed against me, but the loss of my daughter will be a non-factor to the law because she wasn't 'born and alive'.

""To clarify, I am neither pro-choice nor pro-life, I am very much neutral, because most things are never simply black or white.""

Supporters of the RHA suggest that there are existing laws to punish domestic abuse, and the issue should be separated from abortion.

'Groundhog day'

Merle Hoffman, who founded the Choices Women's Medical Center in New York in 1970, welcomes the change in the law, but feels it is ""overdue"".

""I have been working in this field for 48 years. It feels like I've been living in Groundhog day.""

She told the BBC that her clinic has been unable to help women in ""sad and difficult situations"" because they were more than 24 weeks pregnant.

Image copyright Choices Women's Medical Center Image caption Merle Hoffman has been providing abortions in New York since 1970

Ms Hoffman notes that many of the women who seek late-term abortions either didn't know they were pregnant for a long time, or experience complications in an originally wanted pregnancy.

""We have to get funding from various sources - often personally contributing money - to help these women access abortions services out of state.""

Ms Hoffman describes New York in the early 1970s as an ""oasis"" for women seeking abortions before Roe v Wade, and sees a parallel with the state's decision to implement the RHA.

""I can see there being a sort of 'underground railroad' of women who will come to New York now. It is another access point on the east coast.""

Ms Hoffman, is also keen to point out that only around 1% abortions in the US happen after 21 weeks.

'Options not restrictions'

Kaitlyn Marchesano, often answers the phone to people seeking financial help to terminate a pregnancy.

She works for the New York Abortion Access Fund, which supports people who are unable to pay for an abortion.

""Hearing a voice on the other end of the line going through this awful experience is challenging,"" reflects Ms Marchesano. ""The difficulty they face is heart-breaking.""

Ms Marchesano says she finds it ""incredibly frustrating"" that it is so difficult for people to access abortion later in their pregnancy.

Image copyright NYAAF Image caption Kaitlyn Marchesano works to help woman seeking abortions access funding

While abortion is covered by the Medicaid health programme in New York, she says people ""hit a funding wall"" beyond 24 weeks.

""They take on a considerable financial burden when they have to travel out of state. The cost of travel, child care, lost wages, accommodation add up on top of the cost of the procedure.""

""The human body doesn't follow a legal timeline. People need options not restrictions.""

'Grisly and gruesome'

Cardinal Timothy Dolan leads the archdioceses of New York and has been a vocal opponent to the RHA.

Speaking to Fox News, Cardinal Dolan said the new law was ""ghoulish, grisly and gruesome"", and ""not good for our country"".

New York governor Andrew Cuomo, who is a Catholic, has come under fire after signing the law, and some have called for him to be excommunicated..

Cardinal Dolan said he gets ""wheelbarrows full of letters every day"" asking him to take firm action against the governor, but he said it ""would be counterproductive"".

New York,1,https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/new-york-cuomo-green-new-deal-clean-energy,"New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced the launch of a ""Green New Deal"" initiative Tuesday, responding to pressure for bold climate action from progressives and clean energy advocates.

The plan, outlined in Cuomo's 2019 Justice Agenda, calls for a ""globally unprecedented"" ramp-up in renewable energy deployments as New York seeks to achieve 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2040, and ultimately to eliminate its entire carbon footprint.

Former California Governor Jerry Brown signed a similar executive order last fall calling for the Golden State to achieve carbon neutrality economy-wide by 2045. California also passed legislation to achieve 100 percent clean electricity by the same year. If Cuomo's 100 percent carbon-free electricity goal is approved by the state legislature, New York will officially have the most aggressive ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ and legally binding ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ clean energy target in the country.

Nearly quadrupling New YorkÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs offshore wind target to 9,000 megawatts by 2035, up from 2,400 megawatts by 2030

Doubling distributed solar deployment to 6,000 megawatts by 2025, up from 3,000 megawatts by 2023

More than doubling new large-scale, land-based wind and solar resources through the Clean Energy Standard

Maximizing the contributions and potential of New York's existing renewable resources

Deploying 3,000 megawatts of energy storage by 2030

Gov. Cuomo also announced $1.5 billion in competitive awards to support 20 large-scale solar, wind and energy storage projects across upstate New York. These projects are expected to add 1,650 megawatts of capacity and generate enough renewable energy to power nearly 550,000 homes. All projects are expected to be operational by 2022 and create more than 2,600 short- and long-term jobs in the process.

Cuomo for the past year to establish a goal of 1 million solar-powered homes across New York by 2023, the equivalent of the new 6,000-megawatt solar target.

""With Governor CuomoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs commitment to 1one million solar customers, New York will put thousands to work, save millions on electric bills, and spur local economic investments and opportunity to communities all across the state,"" said Sean Garren, senior Northeast director at Vote Solar, who led the Million Solar Strong New York campaign.

""We will continue working with the administration and the legislature to meet this goal and ensure that the growing solar economy meaningfully serves all New Yorkers, including at least 100,000 low-income families,"" he continued.

To hit the 6,000-megawatt target, the Cuomo administration is expected to direct the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) to double the NY-Sun incentive program. To ensure that clean energy is affordable and accessible for low-income and underserved communities, Cuomo will also direct NYSERDA and the Department of Public Service to expand their Solar For All program and couple it with energy savings opportunities.

While elements of the plan pertaining to low- and middle-income customers will be dealt with administratively, Vote Solar said it will also work with legislative allies to get those program benefits enshrined in statute.

As for Cuomo's 100 percent carbon-free electricity goal, it will be part of the state budget, which still has to go through the legislature. Vote Solar and its partners also plan to support that effort.

That task could be made easier by the fact that Democrats took control of the New York State Legislature last election, for the first time in a decade. Growing momentum across the country around the concept of a Green New Deal, championed by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, could also push state lawmakers to make Cuomo's clean energy goals binding.

The council will evaluate a wide range of options for making the state carbon-neutral, including the feasibility of a new multistate emissions reduction program that covers all sectors of the economy.

Roe v. Wade attacks propel new measure

Advocates say the measure is needed to protect abortion access in New York in the event the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade. Tuesday was the 46th anniversary of the landmark court ruling.

ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂThere are lots of bills that are in the hopper at various levels of government seeking to bring the best test case to the Supreme Court for an outright overturning of abortion. What it would do would be to revert (the issue) to the states. New York would be one of the states where a womanÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs basic rights would be protected,"" said Assemblywoman Deborah Glick, a Manhattan Democrat and the billÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs sponsor in the 150-member Assembly.

Glick said parts of the measure passed Tuesday were about codifying New York law with federal case law, including Roe v. Wade. Other sections, such as expanding who can perform abortions, go beyond those case laws to stake out new legal ground in New York.

In 2016, the most recent year for which statistics are available, 82,189 abortions were performed in the state. Ninety-one percent were performed in settings other than a hospital. Fifty-seven percent of those were for women between the ages of 20 and 29. Just over 1,700, or 2.3 percent, were conducted when fetuses were at or after 20 weeks old. Just over 2,800 abortions were performed in Erie and Niagara counties that year, according to state Health Department data.

To claims that the new measure will increase late-term abortions, Glick said such procedures ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂare generally individual tragedies. Those are wanted pregnancies that either go awry or a womanÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs health is dramatically impacted."" She said women needing late-term abortions often needed to travel to other states because abortions conducted after the 24th week other than to save a womanÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs life was a criminal penalty.

But critics, led chiefly by Republicans in the Legislature, say the measure will lead to more abortions in New York, especially later in a pregnancy.

ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂThe proponents have been saying this is merely a codification of Roe v. Wade.

""It will make it much easier for late term abortions and partial birth abortions.""

Later that session, New York made national headlines and joined a movement by a handful of other states in making abortion legal. Three years later, the Supreme Court OK'd abortion.

Last week, Cuomo proposed taking the Reproductive Health Act a step further: putting abortion protections into the state constitution. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂLetÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs write the rights of Roe v. Wade into the state constitution so it can never be changed. No matter what happens politically,"" Cuomo said in his State of the State speech.

In 1970, like now, a leading voice against the abortion efforts was the Catholic Church, which in 1970 characterized the abortion bill as ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂtragic.""

Senate Democratic takeover pushes bill to passage

The path to passage of the RHA began in earnest in the Assembly in 2006. Republicans in control of the Senate reliably blocked the measure over the years. The GOP dominance ended with decisive defeats at the hands of Democrats in November.

Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a Westchester Democrat, recalled how she introduced the abortion measure in 2007. She said the idea was called ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂcrazyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ and a ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂsolution seeking a problemÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ because no one really thought Roe v.

Senate Republicans, though, warned that the new measure will have dangerous consequences. They said the legislation repeals criminal code language regarding illegal abortions. They brought a woman to the Capitol from the Bronx who was attacked last year by her then-boyfriend; the multiple stabbing killed the 26-week-old fetus she was carrying and the man was charged with committing an illegal abortion.

State Sen.

Lawmakers push expanded contraceptive insurance coverage

It's not health insurance; it's the city paying for direct comprehensive care for those who can't afford it or are undocumented

The $100M plan will roll out this year; NYers can access the program via the city's website or by calling 311.

New York City will begin guaranteeing comprehensive health care to every single resident regardless of someone's ability to pay or immigration status, an unprecedented plan that will protect the more than half-a-million New Yorkers currently using the ER as a primary provider, Mayor Bill de Blasio said.



It's not health insurance, his spokesman clarified after the surprise announcement on MSNBC Tuesday morning.



""This is the city paying for direct comprehensive care (not just ERs) for people who can't afford it, or can't get comprehensive Medicaid ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ including 300,000 undocumented New Yorkers,"" spokesman Eric Phillips tweeted.

At a press conference Tuesday, de Blasio said the plan will provide primary and specialty care, from pediatrics to OBGYN, geriatric, mental health and other services, to the city's roughly 600,000 uninsured.

The city already has the foundation for such a plan ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ a public health insurance option that helps get direct care to undocumented residents.

That option will be expanded, the mayor said, and supported with the addition of a new program called NYC Care. Patients who seek health coverage through NYC Care will receive a card that allows them to see a primary care doctor and seek specialty care services, de Blasio said.

Those who can afford to pay will pay for services on a sliding scale, while those who can't will receive free coverage, he noted.

New Yorkers will be able to access the program through the city's website or simply by calling 311. There will be no tax hikes to fund it, the mayor said.

""The programs will include customer-friendly call lines to help New Yorkers ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ regardless of their insurance ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ make appointments with general practitioners, cardiologists, pediatricians, gynecologists and a full spectrum of health care services,"" his office said in a release.

NYC Care is expected to launch in the Bronx this summer and be available in the other four boroughs in 2021, the release said.

It'll cost at least $100 million, accordinng to the release.

""We'll put the money in to make it work; it's going to save us money down the line,"" de Blasio said on MSNBC. ""We're already paying an exorbitant amount to pay for health care the wrong way when what we should be doing is helping them get the primary care.""



""This has never been done in the country in a comprehensive way,"" de Blasio said on MSNBC. ""Health care isn't just a right in theory, it must be a right in practice. And we're doing that here in this city.""

Primary care doctors are already scarce in many areas, according to Dr. Tamara Moise, who runs an urgent care center in East Flatbush.

""For the primary care doctors, we will have a large influx of people who did not have insurance who now will,"" she told News 4.

Los Angeles,1,https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/22/us/los-angeles-teachers-strike-day-6/index.html,"(CNN) The six-day Los Angeles teachers' strike ended Tuesday night after teachers and staff members threw their support behind a new agreement reached hours earlier, according to a preliminary vote tally.

The vote by members of the United Teachers Los Angeles union enables teachers to return to work on Wednesday, ending a battle that left 600,000 students in limbo.

Preliminary numbers from the vote show that ""a vast super majority"" voted yes, ending the strike, UTLA President Alex Caputo-Pearl told reporters late Tuesday.

He said the counting of the ballots will continue on Wednesday.

""It's a historic day today in Los Angeles,"" he said.

""Our members after a strike that began on Monday, January 14, are going to be heading back to school, to the students that they love and the classrooms that they love and the schools that they love and are committed to,"" he added.

The new agreement with the district includes a 6% raise, a gradual decrease in class sizes over the next few years and more counselors, librarians and nurses.

Union leaders and the Los Angeles Unified School District had struck a tentative deal around dawn Tuesday after a marathon 21-hour negotiating session, Mayor Eric Garcetti said.

""It is a historic agreement,"" the mayor, who helped mediate the dueling sides, said before Tuesday's vote. ""It gets to lower class sizes. It gets to proper support staff.""

Unified (@LASchools) January 22, 2019

Caputo-Pearl praised the more than 30,000 teachers and staff members who picketed for six days, often under cold rain.

""I'm so proud of our members, classroom teachers, counselors, nurses, librarians, psychologists,"" Caputo-Pearl said earlier Tuesday.

He made those remarks at a news conference standing next to Beutner -- a symbolic sight, considering Beutner has been the target of intense UTLA criticism for months.

While both sides gathered in harmony Tuesday, ""the strike was painful, and it had a cost,"" Garcetti said.

Thousands of teachers marched in the rain demanding more school staffing and higher salaries.

The first week of the strike cost the school district more than $125 million . That's because the state of California funds schools based on daily attendance, and the number of students going to school plunged during the strike.

Some parents said they purposefully kept their kids out of school in hopes that the money drain suffered by the district would lead to a resolution more quickly.

Why so many teachers toughed it out

For the past six school days, educators hit the picket lines to demand smaller class sizes, higher salaries and more school nurses and counselors.

""We work with students every day who face trauma and face hardship,"" Garfield High School teacher Erika Huerta said. ""So we're doing this as a life passion to improve our community.""

Teachers and students who joined them on the picket lines decried class sizes of 45 or more. They said many students aren't able to get the individual attention they need to effectively learn.

So the standoff between UTLA and LAUSD came down to two issues: how much money to spend on more school staffing and teachers' raises, and whether the school district actually has that kind of money.

The union wanted the school district to pony up more money to meet its demands, but LAUSD said its $1.8 billion in reserves is already earmarked for education spending during this three-year budget cycle.

The school district agreed that schools need smaller class sizes, more staffing and bigger raises for teachers.

""The issue has always been how do we pay for it,"" Beutner said. ""We can't solve 40 years of underinvestment in public education in just one week, in just one contract.""

Firefighters and celebrities join the fight

Firefighters marched Tuesday in support of Los Angeles teachers on strike.

During their week-long strike, teachers received support from a barrage of actors musicians and politicians

On Tuesday, they got a big boost from members of the International Association of Firefighters, who are in Los Angeles for a conference this week.

""We stand with LA teachers,"" read signs held by dozens of firefighters as they rallied during a parade Tuesday morning.

Some chanted ""fighting for justice"" as they rode atop a fire truck.",The LA teachers' strike ends after union approves deal with school district," CNN The six-day Los Angeles teachers' strike ended Tuesday night after teachers and staff members threw their support behind a new agreement reached hours earlier, according to a preliminary vote tally.

Los Angeles,1,https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/25727292/los-angeles-chargers-signing-nick-rose-handle-kickoff-duties,"COSTA MESA, Calif. -- The Los Angeles Chargers are signing Nick Rose to handle kickoff duties in Sunday's playoff game against the New England Patriots, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.

The move could help a kicking game that allowed the most returns in the NFL during the regular season.

Chargers rookie kicker Michael Badgley has been productive on field goals and extra points.

In 10 games played during the regular season, Badgley made 15 of 16 fields goals (94 percent), including a franchise-long 59 yarder in a Week 14 contest against the Cincinnati Bengals. Badgley also made 27 of 28 extra points (96.4 percent).

However, Badgley had a touchback on only 9 of his 54 kickoffs during the 2018 regular season. That 16.7 percent rate was the worst in the NFL among players with at least 10 kickoffs in 2018.

The Chargers are concerned with explosive Patriots return man Cordarrelle Patterson, who averaged 28.8 yards per return during the regular season, including one taken back for a 95-yard touchdown.

""They have one of the best kick returners that I've seen in a long time,"" Chargers head coach Anthony Lynn said this week. ""So that's going to be a heck of a challenge for our special teams. It's a good thing we have one of the better cover units in the league right now, but that's going to be a heck of a challenge.""

The Chargers did hold returners to 21.7 yards per kickoff return in the regular season, the eighth-best rate in the league.

Rose kicked in two games for the Chargers at the end of the 2017 season, making 1 of 3 field goals and 5 of 6 extra points. Rose had touchbacks on 8 of his 9 kickoffs for the Bolts last season.

Most of the signs and chants call for better pay, smaller classes and more staff support, but the backdrop to the Los Angeles Unified School District strike is a battle that has long loomed large over education in California: The fight over charter schools.

The countryÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs second-largest public school district, which educates over 480,000 students, has seen a steady decline in enrollment and resources as the areaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs charter school enrollment has nearly doubled in the past decade.

The tensions between teachersÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ unions and organizations representing charter schools have grown at a similar breakneck speed. During the last two statewide elections, each side spent tens of millions of dollars on political campaigns to back candidates for governor and state superintendent of public instruction.

How the acrimony plays out in the Los Angeles strike, the first in 30 years, will have a ripple effect in school districts across California, as many wrestle with similar issues of declining enrollment, dwindling finances and a growing number of charter schools.

Central to the concerns of teachers and union leaders at Los Angeles Unified is the argument that the growth of charter schools in the city has come at the expense of dollars for district schools and the teachers working in them.

ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂWe want LAUSD and the City of L.A., and the County of Los Angeles, to join us in calling for a cap on charter schools,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Alex Caputo-Pearl, president of the union representing the roughly 31,000 striking teachers in Los Angeles, said Tuesday, hours before a large rally in front of the L.A. offices of the stateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs largest charter association. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂThere are too many schools in Los Angeles right now.

We need to invest in our existing schools ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ charter and district.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ

As the United Teachers Los Angeles strike enters its third day, it is using its seat at the bargaining table to push a number of issues related to how charter schools are operated in the district. One, reforming how the district shares classroom space with charter schools, is a specific demand in the unionÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs negotiations with the district. Another, capping the number of charter schools, is a policy goal that the union is keeping top-of-mind during the strike.

Key to the bitter dispute: Charter schools, which enroll about a fifth of students in Los Angeles Unified, have contributed to a loss of $600 million annually that otherwise would benefit students in district schools, according to union officials, largely because of fixed costs that canÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt be reduced even if there are fewer students. Charter backers have pushed back on those figures.

Enrollment in the district has been declining since 2003, when more than 700,000 students were enrolled. Just over 480,000 students occupy seats in the districtÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs schools today. In addition, more than 100,000 are enrolled in independently run charter schools.

Whether charter schools can be fully blamed for the drop in enrollment in district schools is an open question.

Because districts receive state money for the number of students they enroll, union leaders say students leaving for charter schools means less money for the district to cover the kinds of expenses the striking teachers are demanding. Those include a 6.5-percent salary increase, a reduction in class sizes and more money for support staff, such as nurses and school counselors.

In the days and weeks leading up to the strike, union officials have sought changes in how traditional public schools provide space to charter schools. State law requires districts to free up unused classrooms and other facilities for charter schools.

Specific to the contract dispute, Caputo-Pearl said his union wants limits on whatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs shared to free up computer labs, dance studios and music centers that can be used by students and teachers, even if the rooms arenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt used all the time.

Los Angeles Unified District officials say the unionÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs charter-school demands are beyond the scope of what state law says can be discussed during negotiations.

ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂItÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs not an appropriate subject for bargaining,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ said Robert Samples, the districtÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs interim director of labor relations, saying these are issues that would have to be resolved in the Legislature.

He said the district proposed forming a working group to discuss how charter and district schools can share space. The union has called that proposal inadequate.

Disputes over how charter and public schools should coexist donÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt seem to have a place in contract negotiations, said Pedro Noguera, a UCLA professor of education and founder of the Center for Transformation of Schools.

ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂIÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂm not sure politically what theyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂre trying to gain through the strikeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ regarding charter schools, Noguera said.

If the main issue for striking teachers is more money, Noguera said, United Teachers Los Angeles is already in a stronger position thanks to newly elected Gov. Gavin Newsom.

In his first state budget proposal last week, Newsom proposed more money for K-12 education and extra dollars for school districts to pay their massive pension obligations ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ a growing cost pressure for districts. The budget also included more money for homelessness and mental health services, ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂall of which can translate into additional services and support for children served by LAUSD,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ the governor said in a statement this week.

For Caputo-Pearl, though, the bigger issue is charter expansion. He thinks the show of strength this week during the strike will put pressure on state leaders to limit charter growth.

In response to questions about the strike this week, Newsom indicated that he is eager to sign legislation promoted by UTLA and other teachers unions requiring more transparency in charter school operations.

There is growing evidence that the charter sector in Los Angeles is having its own enrollment troubles, raising questions about whether there are more charter schools than there is demand.

A recent district report concluded that charter schools the district authorized are struggling to reach enrollment goals. In 2017-18, independent charter schools overseen by the district enrolled 15,882 fewer students than what the charter school operators projected. Only 34 of 224 charter schools met or exceeded their enrollment targets.

The union on Tuesday held a rally outside of the Los Angeles office of the California Charter Schools Association, the stateÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs main charter school membership organization, which has received millions of dollars from wealthy donors through its political arm that it then distributes to candidates running for office.

Myrna CastrejÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ³n, president and CEO of the charter schools association, said she supports the unionÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs demands for better pay and working conditions. But she added that while demand for charter schools in Los Angeles varies by neighborhood, around 16,000 students are on waitlists to get into particular charter schools in Los Angeles.

Disagreements aside, teachers in both district and charter schools should have better pay and access to more resources, Caputo-Pearl said.

One of the three Accelerated Schools charter campuses, whose teachers are also represented by United Teachers Los Angeles, joined the strike on Tuesday ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ the first charter school strike in California history, according to the union.

Teachers at unionized charter schools in Los Angeles are sympathetic to the strike.

Some teachers at the Green Dot charter school network, represented by the AsociaciÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ³n de Maestros Unidos, which like UTLA is affiliated with the California Teachers Association, took paid time off to walk the picket lines with Los Angeles Unified teachers.

Los Angeles,1,https://www.cbssports.com/general/news/dallas-cowboys-vs-los-angeles-rams-prediction-pick-odds-spread-line-complete-game-preview/,"In the NFL playoffs, your next opponent often comes down to the luck of the draw and that's exactly why the Los Angeles Rams will be hosting the Dallas Cowboys on Saturday.

This is a game that almost didn't happen. If Bears kicker Cody Parkey had been able to knock through a 43-yard field goal against the Eagles on Sunday, then the Cowboys would be headed for New Orleans this weekend and the Bears would have been playing the Rams. Instead, Parkey's kick was knocked off course by an Eagles player, sending the Bears out of the playoffs and the Cowboys to Los Angeles.

Somehow, the luck of the draw always seems to bring these two teams together in the postseason. This Saturday's game will mark the ninth time in NFL history that the Rams and Cowboys have met in the playoffs, which is notable, because no two teams have met more.

Although they haven't played each other in the playoffs since 1985, these two teams have more postseason meetings than more glamorous rivalries like 49ers-Giants and Cowboys-Packers, which have both happened seven times in NFL playoff history.

The all-time playoff series between these two teams is tied 4-4 and the team that breaks the tie on Saturday will be getting a nice prize: A trip to the NFC Championship game. If the Cowboys pull off the upset, they'll be headed to their first NFC title game since January 1996. If the Rams can pick up their first playoff win under Sean McVay, they'll be headed to the NFC Championship for the first time since January 2002.

Storylines

Cowboys: To get to their first NFC title game since 1995, the Cowboys are going to have to exorcise a few postseason demons this week. For one, the Cowboys have been one of the NFL's worst road playoff teams over the past 25 years. Since 1993, the Cowboys have gone on the road seven different times for a playoff game and they've lost every single one of those games, a total that includes one loss under Jason Garrett. The Cowboys have also struggled in the divisional round of the playoffs. Since their last NFC title berth in 1995, the Cowboys have gone 0-5 in the divisional round. After 25 years of struggling, the Cowboys will be looking to change their luck this week.

Although the Cowboys should be at nearly full strength when they take the field in L.A., there are two injuries to keep an eye on. Wide receiver Cole Beasley has been dealing with an ankle injury all season and he got even more banged up during the Cowboys' win over Seattle on Saturday. There's no guarantee that Beasley will play and Jason Garrett has said that it will on come down to how Beasley feels as the week goes on. Another player dealing with an ankle injury is left guard Xavier Su'a-Filo, who didn't play against the Seahawks. Luckily for the Cowboys, it sounds like he's likely going to be on the field. Garrett said this week that he's ""optimistic"" that Su'a-Filo will play against the Rams, which would definitely be good news for a Cowboys offensive line that will be going up against Aaron Donald and Ndamukong Suh.

Rams: One of the biggest storylines in this game for the Rams will be the health of Todd Gurley. After sitting out the final two games of the regular season due to a knee injury, Gurley is expected to be on the field against the Cowboys, but it's not clear if he'll be 100 percent. Although C.J. Anderson filled in admirably while Gurley was out, averaging 149.5 yards per game, those two performances came against the Cardinals and 49ers, two teams that aren't nearly as good as the Cowboys when it comes to stopping the run. Not only did the Cowboys rank fifth in the NFL against the run in 2018, but they also completely shut down a Seahawks ground attack that finished the season as the league's top rushing team. The Rams are likely going to need a big game from Gurley if they want to advance.

What needs to happen

Cowboys: The Cowboys offensive game plan on Saturday basically boils down to two words: Feed Zeke. If the Cowboys are going to pull off the upset in Los Angeles, they're going to need a big game from Ezekiel Elliott. The good news for the Cowboys is that if there's one team they should be able to run all over, it's the Rams. Although Aaron Donald led the NFL in sacks this year with 20.5, that didn't really help the Rams when it came to stopping the run. During the regular season, the Rams surrendered 5.1 yards per carry, which was the worst performance by any defense in the NFL in 2018. When going up against a defense like that, Elliott is basically the perfect weapon to have. Not only did the Cowboys running back lead the NFL in rush yards (1,434), but he also averaged 4.7 yards per carry during the regular season. In the Cowboys wild-card win over the Seahawks, Elliott totaled 169 yards and a touchdown (137 yards and a touchdown on the ground, 32 yards through the air).

Rams: The Rams need Jared Goff to get off to a hot start so he doesn't lose any confidence. Although the Rams lit up the scoreboard during the final two weeks of the season by scoring 48 and 31 points, those games came against bad teams in the 49ers and Cardinals. In the two weeks before that, the Rams played two playoff teams -- the Bears and Eagles -- and Goff struggled big time, throwing five interceptions and zero touchdowns in two games that the Rams ended up losing. Goff also struggled in his only playoff appearance last season, a game the Rams lost to the Falcons 26-13. The Rams were limited to just 13 points against the Falcons after leading the NFL in scoring in 2017, and a big reason for that was because Goff never got on track. Aaron Donald and Todd Gurley are important players for the Rams, but they can still win if either of those guys has an off day. However, the Rams have almost no chance of winning if Goff has an ugly game.

Game prediction

Point spread: Rams, -7 points

The Rams have one glaring weakness this year -- stopping the run -- and unfortunately for L.A., the Cowboys are the one team left in the playoffs that's perfectly built to exploit that weakness. Ezekiel Elliott is probably licking his chops at the thought of going up against the Rams defense and it won't be surprising at all if he has a huge night with 150 rushing yards or more. If the Rams can jump out to a big early lead, they might be able to get the Cowboys away from their ground game, but that won't be easy. The guess here: Zeke runs wild as the Cowboys pull off the upset win.

Davis was all over the field for the Saints. He had 14 total tackles including 1.5 tackles-for-loss. In addition, he was the beneficiary of an interception off a deflection from Rams RB Todd Gurley early in the game.

WR Michael Thomas

The Rams did a much better job in containing WR Thomas. He was limited to seven targets, four receptions, and 36 yards. The Rams gave him multiple looks including zone, man with a lurking LB/S, press man, and off man. In the end, Thomas was contained and the return of CB Aqib Talib definitely helped.

The reason: the strike came at a time when labor unions were supposedly weakened by the Supreme CourtÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs decision last June in the Janus vs. AFSCME case, ruling that workers do not have to pay mandatory union fees even if a union represents them at the bargaining table.

It was a strike that United Teachers Los Angeles, representing over 30,000 teachers, had to win by delivering on the key demands they put on the table: not only higher salaries but a range of support services intended to improve working conditions and studentsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ academic outcomes.

There was widespread expectation that the Janus lawsuit ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ filed by several right-wing organizations on behalf of Mark Janus, a social worker in Illinois ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ would diminish the influence of public sector unions, especially in California, where they are powerful forces in the workplace and in state politics generally.

With less revenue, the reasoning went, unions would have less lobbying clout, a smaller war chest to contribute to political campaigns and less money to organize workers.

The strike in Los Angeles stood out at least in part because it was the largest, at least in terms of the number of workers involved, since the Supreme CourtÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Janus ruling. UTLA President Alex Caputo-Pearl acknowledged its significance at the press conference announcing the contract agreement in City Hall this week.

The L.A. strike, Caputo-Pearl suggested, should put that issue to rest.

The strike was a declaration that public sector unions are still alive. Instead of being weakened by the Janus ruling, UTLA was able to mobilize tens of thousands of teachers and generate support from other teachers around the state in a show of statewide unity not seen in decades.

The importance of the strike was underscored by the on-the-ground presence of the leaders of the largest teacher organizations in the nation: Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, and Lily Eskelsen Garcia of the National Education Association.

As Mayor Eric Garcetti noted, the strike ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂwas painful and had a cost.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ But it should boost the spirits of labor organizers nationally, especially teachersÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ unions waging similar battles. The strike settlement came at a time when unions struggle to maintain a firm foothold in the labor market. Union membership has now reached historic lows, according to a report issued last week by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 2018, only 6.4 percent of workers in the private sector belonged to a union.

But if there has been any bright spot, it is in the public sector, where unions are still strong, with a unionization rate five times that of the private sector. In California, those rates are much higher than national ones. About 59 percent of public sector workers in California belonged to a union last year, according to the UC Berkeley Labor Center, compared to about 34 percent nationally.

In this strike, teachers were bargaining from a position of strength. Public opinion polls show that teachers are generally respected and that most Americans think teachers are underpaid. During the strike, they enjoyed widespread support from parents and others in Los Angeles. That was strengthened by union demands for more counselors and other support staff who arguably would benefit children and their families more than teachers. The strategy appeared to be influenced, intentionally or not, by a new approach to organizing called ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂbargaining for the common good.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ

Also UTLA currently is arguably in the strongest position it could hope to be in the wake of the Janus decision, whose longer term impact has yet to be felt. ThatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs because the union has so far been able to convince most teachers to opt into the union and pay their union fees, even though they are no longer mandatory.

But these were mostly teachers who have become accustomed to paying dues, the ones most likely to be most appreciative of the unionÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs value. Over time, as newer and younger teachers come into the profession, they may not feel the same allegiance, especially as they cope with the impact of high housing costs and they make tough decisions about where and how to spend their lowly beginning teacher salaries.

Now the union must assess what it has gained and what it has lost as a result of the strike. One unfortunate outcome is that the district said it lost an estimated $125 million in state funds it would have received if students had been in school, although that amount was offset by the approximately $60 million it saved in not have to pay teacher and other salaries. The district now may be in even weaker financial shape than it was before the strike, and many questions remain as to how it will pay for everything it agreed to at the bargaining table.

But it is clear that, for now, the union is still a potent force, despite ongoing efforts to weaken it and render it irrelevant in Los Angeles and California.

Los Angeles,1,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/us/charter-schools-los-angeles.html,"Charter schools, which are generally not unionized, were not officially on the bargaining table in the protracted negotiations between the union and the district. It is the state, not the school district, that crafts the laws governing charter schools and their growth. But it was always a central message of the union during the strike: Charter schools, they argued, were taking students and money away from traditional public schools.

Still, charter schools have proven popular among many parents in Los Angeles. Some schools have long waiting lists and the district already has more students enrolled in charters than any other public school system in the country.

It is still unclear how much practical impact the deal will have on charters. Charter school supporters are lobbying the school board, which has steadfastly supported charters for more than a decade, to vote down the resolution for a charter school cap this week. Even if it passes, advocates are certain to take the fight to Sacramento, where a bill calling for a moratorium seems likely. They will argue that charters have given poor students and students of color essential options for better schools.

Over the past two years, charter school supporters were dealt painful political defeats in California, New York, Massachusetts, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and other states.

Former Eagles kicker Cody Parkey hit the left upright and then the crossbar with a field-goal attempt from 43 yards with 10 seconds remaining, silencing the raucous crowd.

The defending league champion Eagles (10-7) squeezed into the playoffs by beating Washington and having the Bears (12-5) help them by knocking off Minnesota in the season finale. Philadelphia thanked its benefactor with a 12-play, 60-yard drive on which Foles, the Super Bowl MVP last February, hit six passes.

Philly plays at New Orleans (13-3) next Sunday.

No team has repeated as Super Bowl champion since New England in 2004, and the Eagles are a sixth seed. The last sixth seed to win the NFL title was Green Bay in the 2010 season.

But these Eagles, led by Foles and a defense down to backups at several positions, seem to have that magical touch like last season.

It was a sizzling ending to a game marked by superior defense and several critical mistakes by the Eagles. They had to survive after Tarik Cohen, an All-Pro punt returner, took back the kickoff following Philly's go-ahead score 35 yards. Mitchell Trubisky completed two passes to get the Bears close enough for Parkey. But his kick took a double deflection and fell harmlessly into the end zone.

The two low-quality images appear to show two people wearing all black clothing, matching the description of the attackers given to police by Smollett. Police say they were walking on New Street near Illinois Street between 1:30 a.m. and 1:45 a.m. Smollett told officers the attack happened at 2 a.m. about one block away. Not much else can be determined from the photos.

Until Wednesday evening, police had said detectives did not have enough information to release a description of the attackers despite reviewing hundreds of hours of video from the surrounding area.

Smollett was reportedly attacked around 2 a.m. Tuesday as he was walking back to an apartment after a late-night meal at a Subway restaurant at 511 N. McClurg Court, police said.

Two men indicated they recognized Smollet and yelled racist and homophobic slurs at Smollett in the 300 block of East North Lower Water Street, before they hit him in the face, poured what is suspected to be bleach on him and put a rope around his neck, Smollett told police.

After describing the attackers as men wearing ski-masks and all black clothing in an initial report filed with police, Smollett told detectives in a follow-up interview that the men yelled ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂthis is MAGA countryÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ after they assaulted him.

Smollett was talking to his agent on the phone when the attack started, Guglielmi said.

Smollett was treated for lacerations to his face and neck at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and later released.

The block where the attack took place has parking garage entrances but no retail businesses. Police recovered video from various business, residential and police cameras in the wider area, but none until Wednesday showed any possible suspects. Surveillance camera at the Subway shows Smollett at the restaurant.

More than a dozen police detectives, some specializing in hate crimes, are working the case. They asked anyone who has information or witnessed the attack to call detectives at (312) 747-8382 or submit an anonymous tip at cpdtip.com.

Congressman Bobby Rush on Wednesday wrote a letter to the FBI asking the bureau to open a hate crime investigation into the attack.

Chicago police are investigating the brutal incident as a hate crime. Meanwhile, the FBI is separately looking into a letter threatening the actor sent a week ago to the offices of the television show.

The actor, 35-year-old Jussie Smollett, flew into Chicago from New York on Monday to continue filming the new season of ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂEmpire.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ

Smollett went for a late-night meal sometime after midnight at a Subway restaurant at 511 N. McClurg Court, police said. The actor was walking back to a nearby apartment about 2 a.m. when two people walked up to him in the 300 block of East North Lower Water Street, yelling racist and homophobic slurs, Smollett told police.

Smollett initially was ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂreluctantÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ to call police because of the attention he would generate as a public figure, Guglielmi said. But his manager eventually called at 2:42 a.m., about 40 minutes after the attack.

The block where the attack took place has some parking garage entrances but no retail businesses. But police were able to recover video from various business, residential and police cameras in the wider area. A surveillance camera at the Subway shows Smollett at the restaurant.

More than a dozen police detectives, some specializing in hate crimes, are working the case. They asked anyone with who has information or witnessed the attack to call detectives at (312) 747-8382 or submit an anonymous tip at cpdtip.com.

Miami,1,https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/miami-hotel-dishwasher-forced-to-work-sundays-awarded-21-million-by-jury/3417/,"A former dishwasher at a Miami hotel, fired after missing work on Sundays for religious reasons, was awarded a $21 million jury verdict.

Sixty-year-old Marie Jean Pierre was a dishwasher at the Conrad Miami Hotel for more than a decade until she was fired in March 2016.

Pierre, a devout Christian missionary born in Haiti, said she was fired by her boss at the hotel after she missed six Sundays from work to attend Bethel Baptist Church in Miami.

Pierre argued that she had informed her employer when she was hired that she could not work Sundays because of her religious beliefs and should not have been scheduled to work on the Sundays she missed.

""I love God. No work on Sunday, because Sunday I honor God,"" Pierre said Wednesday in an interview with NBC 6 Miami.

Her lawsuit argued that her former employer, which was managed by Hilton at the time, had violated the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which protects workers from discrimination on the basis of race, religion, sex or national origin.

A jury in federal court ruled in her favor on Monday, granting her $21 million in damages, plus $35,000 in back wages and $500,000 for emotional pain and mental anguish.

""They accommodated her for seven years, and they easily could have accommodated her, but instead of doing that, they set her up for absenteeism and threw her out,"" her attorney Marc Brumer said. ""She's a soldier of Christ. She was doing this for all the other workers who are being discriminated against.""

The company said it was disappointed by the jury's decision and that it intends to appeal.

""During Ms. PierreÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs ten years with the hotel, multiple concessions were made to accommodate her personal and religious commitments,"" Hilton said in a statement.

Federal law requires an employer to make reasonable considerations for religious practices. Brumer said he hopes the verdict sets a standard.

""This was not about money. This was about sending a message to other corporations whether big or small,"" he said. ""Whatever size you are, if youÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂre going to take the blood and sweat of your workers, you better accommodate them or let them at least believe in their religious beliefs.""

There is a cap on punitive damage awards in federal court, so Pierre can't receive the entire $21 million. But her attorney said he expects she will receive at least $500,000.

""I asked for $50 million, knowing that I was capped at $300,000,"" Brumer told NBC News on Wednesday. ""I didn't do this for money. I did this to right the wrongs.""",Miami Hotel Dishwasher Forced to Work Sundays Awarded 21 Million by Jury,"A former dishwasher at a Miami hotel, fired after missing work on Sundays for religious reasons, was awarded a 21 million jury verdict.

Martell exemplifies all those twists and turns more than most. He was a four-star quarterback who starred at high school powerhouse Bishop Gorman High School in Las Vegas, and his story was chronicled in the Netflix series ""QB1: Beyond the Lights."" Of course Martell was going to be popular, given that backstory by the time he arrived on campus ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ maybe too popular, given the comparisons to former Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel.

You could argue that exposure makes a quarterback more prepared for FBS competition, or more likely to transfer. There's truth to both sides.

Martell didn't play much as a freshman behind J.T. Barrett in 2017, but he launched into a three-way quarterback battle with Dwayne Haskins and Joe Burrow last spring with the expectation he would play.

""There will be packages (for me to contribute) if I don't win the starting job,"" Martell told reporters during spring practice.

Haskins won the starting job and finished third in the Heisman Trophy voting. Burrow transferred to LSU as a graduate transfer. Martell played in small doses and showed some of that playmaking ability that made him a viral sensation at Ohio State.

That was evident in the opener against Oregon State on Sept. 1, when Martell bolted into the secondary before launching a sideways pitch to C.J. Saunders for a first down.

""From my angle I thought he fumbled the ball, so my heart jumped out of my throat,"" Ohio State acting coach Ryan Day said afterward. ""He was actually being Tate, which is he's a playmaker. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¦ That's what he did there. He's a playmaker. So, as the season goes on, he'll have more and more opportunities to show that.""

Martell finished 10 of 10 for 121 yards with 95 rushing yards and two total touchdowns in mop-up duty against Rutgers the next week, but he wasn't used much more than that. He finished with 269 passing yards, 128 rushing yards and three touchdowns this season, but was still a polarizing talent with the fan base.

It still appeared Martell would be the odds-on favorite to take over for the Buckeyes in 2019. With Day taking over for Urban Meyer, however, Martell's future at Ohio State was questioned before it even started. Martell's situation was impacted by Justin Fields, a five-star recruit who transferred from Georgia after just one season with the Bulldogs and will apply for hardship waiver that would allow him to play right away at Ohio State.

When two highly touted recruits collide, this is going to happen every time. That's one issue with this trend, and an adjustment fans will be forced to make as quarterbacks come and go. The veneer of commitment between coach and quarterback ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ and player and school ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ is thinner now than it's ever been. Ohio State is not the exception. Look at SN's pre-preseason top 25, where nine of the top 10 schools have been affected by the transfer market in the past year.

MORE: SN's pre-preseason top 25 for 2019

Kelly Bryant and Hunter Johnson transferred once it was clear the Trevor Lawrence era was in effect at Clemson. Notre Dame's Brandon Wimbush transferred to UCF. Jalen Hurts ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ who led Alabama to two College Football Playoff championship games ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ transferred to Oklahoma. Then Oklahoma's Austin Kendall, after initially being blocked, transferred to West Virginia.

It's a dizzying process for both sides. You can't blame Day for taking in a five-star transfer. ItÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs his job to win football games and bring in competition at every position.

You also can't blame Martell for leaving either, even when he told reporters at Ohio State's Rose Bowl media day he was ""100 percent sure"" he would be the starting quarterback at Ohio State next season.

Tate Martell was asked who is going to be the next starting quarterback at Ohio State.

""I will.""

Level of confidence?

""I'm 100-percent sure on that."" ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Austin Ward (@AWardSports) December 30, 2018

Things change. You could say Martell didn't want to compete with Fields or that the Buckeyes have their mind made up about the future. In reality, this was the best chance for both quarterbacks to play.

That's also life in the transfer portal, and thatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs why the fact a school lands a four- or five-star quarterback doesn't mean quite as much as it used to. The impact for Ohio State could be felt if Fields is not granted the waiver, and that would open the door for Matthew Baldwin to start. Martell could also apply for a waiver, perhaps based on the coaching change, but if the NCAA allows that, it opens the door for even more transfers.

That is a lot of paperwork. It's becoming clear the graduate transfer rule, which allows players to play immediately if they graduate from the previous school, will not be enough to slow the influx of transfer quarterbacks. What are the possible solutions? Will the NCAA eventually allow players to transfer without sitting out a year? What kind of restrictions for the players or schools come with?

That will take time, but a more player-friendly transfer system will only help ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ and deflect from the ongoing pay-for-play argument.

TUSCALOOSA ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ The exodus of Nick Saban's assistant coaching staff continued into Friday after the University of Miami announced the hiring of now-former Alabama quarterbacks coach Dan Enos as the Hurricanes' new offensive coordinator.

Enos, who was reportedly rumored to be the front-runner to replace Mike Locksley as the Crimson Tide's offensive coordinator, left Alabama after just a season in Tuscaloosa, where he was viewed as instrumental to the development of the Crimson Tide's record-breaking passing attack this season. Enos was also credited with further developing dual-threat quarterback Jalen Hurts into a more refined passer.

""Dan was my primary target for our offensive coordinator position from the outset and I'm thrilled that he's now a Miami Hurricane,"" new Miami head coach Manny Diaz said in a statement announcing Enos' hiring. ""Dan is one of the most innovative play-callers in college football and he not only has a remarkable track record of coaching quarterbacks, but also developing players for the NFL at numerous positions. His experience as a head coach will also provide invaluable insight to our entire program.""

Enos is the fourth member of Alabama's offensive coaching staff to leave the program in the last week, joining co-offensive coordinator and receivers coach Josh Gattis (Michigan), offensive line coach Brent Key (Georgia Tech), and Locksley, who was named Maryland's next head coach last month during the Tide's playoff run. Gattis was named the Wolverines' offensive coordinator Thursday afternoon, while Key returned to his alma mater with the elevated titles of associate head coach and run game coordinator in addition to his offensive line coach responsibilities.

Special teams coordinator and tight ends coach Jeff Banks and running backs coach Joe Pannunzio are all that's left of last season's offensive staff, which helped set multiple single-season program records in 2018.

Under Enos' tutelage as quarterbacks coach, Alabama sophomore Tua Tagovailoa reset the standard for quarterbacks in Tuscaloosa, throwing for a single-season record 3,966 passing yards and 43 touchdowns en route to finishing as the Heisman Trophy runner-up this season. Tagovailoa also won the Maxwell and Walter Camp Player of the Year awards.

Miami would be Enos' 12th program in his 28 years as a collegiate assistant, and third in the past three seasons ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ fourth if counting his brief month-long foray at Michigan last winter.

Seargent Gustavo De Los Rios, 38, was charged with a misdemeanor for the incident which took place in February.

The video shows several officers arresting a suspect, then De Los Rios is seen kicking the suspect once and then dropping his knee on his neck.

De Los Rios was relieved of duty with pay at the time the complaint was filed.

The incident occurred in Miami Lakes on ValentineÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs Day of 2018.

Officers pulled over a teenager wanted for burglary on 57th avenue. According to prosecutors, the teen fought officers who tried to use their Taser.

Eventually, he was placed in handcuffs on the ground. ThatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs when according to the state attorney, De Los Rios crossed the line.

Personally, De Los Rios has had a rocky few years. He was arrested for domestic abuse in an incident with his ex-wife last year. Court filings show restraining orders as well.
